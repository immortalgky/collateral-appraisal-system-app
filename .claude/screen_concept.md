# Photo Gallery

When the appraiser goes to the site. they will keep take a photo and upload it into the gallery.
then, when the appraiser comes back to the office, they will go to collateral and upload a new photo or choose from a
gallery.
so the gallery is the appraisal application level and collateral is the colalteral level.
